# Northwind-Database-Example
with this simple application, I am using the MVC Pattern in C# to retrieve category, supplier, and product information from the Northwind Database using the OLEDB database Driver. To view this project, please open the sln file in visual studio. Please note that to view the pages that display the information I am getting back from the database, you will have to add the Northwind.mdb file to C:/Users/Owner/Downloads, and you will have to type in the URL manually to view the product, supplier, and category pages. The uri for each is ByProduct, BySupplier, and ByCategory, respectively
